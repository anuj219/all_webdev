                <p id="news1d" class="details">Manu Bhaker finished second in women's 25 pistol qualification shooting a total of 590 (294 in precision, 296 in rapid) out of a possible 600 and thus reached her third final of the Paris Olympics. Archers Ankita Bhakat and Dhiraj Bommadevara became the first Indians to reach the mixed team semi-finals. However, they couldn't go past South Korea and then lost to the USA in the bronze medal match. Lakshya Sen later became the first Indian to reach the semi-finals of men's singles badminton at the Olympics. Lakshya Sen prevailed in an intense quarterfinal clash against Chou Tien Chen of Chinese Taipei to make history at the Paris Olympics. He has become the first Indian man to reach the singles semi-final in badminton at the Olympics. Earlier, Ankita Bhakat and Dhiraj Bommadevara made history by becoming the first Indians to reach the semi-finals in mixed-team archery at the Olympics. </p>

                </div>
                <p id="news2d" class="details">In the latest example of a troubling industry pattern, NVIDIA appears to have scraped troves of copyrighted content for AI training. On Monday, 404 Media’s Samantha Cole reported that the $2.4 trillion company asked workers to download videos from YouTube, Netflix and other datasets to develop commercial AI projects. The graphics card maker is among the tech companies appearing to have adopted a “move fast and break things” ethos as they race to establish dominance in this feverish, too-often-shameful AI gold rush.

                    The training was reportedly to develop models for products like its Omniverse 3D world generator, self-driving car systems and “digital human” efforts.
                    
                    NVIDIA defended its practice in an email to Engadget. A company spokesperson said its research is “in full compliance with the letter and the spirit of copyright law” while claiming IP laws protect specific expressions “but not facts, ideas, data, or information.” The company equated the practice to a person’s right to “learn facts, ideas, data, or information from another source and use it to make their own expression.” Human, computer… what’s the difference?
                    
                    YouTube doesn’t appear to agree. Spokesperson Jack Malon pointed us to a Bloomberg story from April, quoting CEO Neal Mohan saying using YouTube to train AI models would be a “clear violation” of its terms. “Our previous comment still stands,” the YouTube policy communications manager wrote to Engadget.</p>

IT industry body Nasscom on Thursday said the latest tax demand reflects a lack of understanding of the sector’s operating model.

The massive correction came after the benchmark index hit its all-time high of 82,129.49 on August 1.Market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms tumbled ₹22,02,996.27 crore to reach ₹4,39,59,953.56 crore (USD 5.24 trillion) in three trading days.

After surging over 1,000 points in early trade, markets steadily erased gains and slipped into the red," Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, said.

                </div>
                <p id="news4d" class="details">Disney is on a roll in 2024, topping $3 billion in worldwide ticket sales as its latest Marvel Studios release Deadpool & Wolverine sits at around $850 million today and heads toward $1 billion box office by its third weekend of release.Deadpool & Wolverine should reach roughly $900 million headed into its third weekend. So, by end of business next Sunday, the Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman starring blockbuster sequel from director Shawn Levy, who cowrote with Reynolds, should easily top $1 billion.

                    Meanwhile, Pixar’s chart-topping Inside Out 2 continues to defy even bullish expectations, and actually managed to drop a mere 25% last weekend despite losing 17% of its screens. The sequel, from director Kelsey Mann with screenwriters Meg LeFauve and Dave Holstein, is already the highest-grossing animated film in cinema history, Pixar’s highest earner of all time, and easily the biggest film of 2024 — so far.At its present trajectory, and assuming continued strong holds but still the inevitably drop-offs, Inside Out 2 should top $1.62 billion if it stays in release long enough — which there’s every reason to expect at this point in the summer box office season.

                    Disney is doing the bulk of the heavy lifting so far this summer, including Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ $397 million cume, Inside Out 2’s $1.55 billion, and Deadpool & Wolverine’s $850 million. Overall receipts are still way down, however.</p>

                    The 84-year-old microfinance pioneer will arrive at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka on an Emirates flight from Dubai on Thursday afternoon, the Yunus Center said in a press release.
                    
               
                    Mr. Yunus asked the youth to be calm and get ready to build the country. “I congratulate the brave students who took the lead in making our ‘Second Victory Day’ possible and to the people for giving your total support to them. Let us make the best use of our new victory. Let us not let this slip away because of our mistakes,” he said in the statement.

The 10-week-long case that took place last year saw high-profile tech leaders like Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella debating the dominance of the Google search engine and arguing whether this was due to the company’s merits or its unfair practices. In the end, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled, per a court record dated August 5, 2024, that Google was a monopolist.</p>
