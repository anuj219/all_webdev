<!-- problems faced :  -->

<!-- tranisiton is not applying to the .cells for flex-grow !!!! solved idk how!!!!! -->
<!-- its because flex-grow is not applied to .cells -- as .cells is not displayed as flex -->
<!-- and if i change .cells to flex, all items inside .cells are getting flex row direction, which i dont want -->
<!-- ohh bhai .. it striked me, agar sab items inside cells are getting rowed, i changed the flex-direction to column and shit ... it worked, got the required layout  -->
<!-- but bhai transition abhi bhi kaam nhi kar rha wtf -->
<!-- transition kaam kar rha hai kaise to -->
<!-- and to be honest, i dont see the difference between using flex-grow and not using it -->
<!-- fuck chal gaya flex-grow, lets go ... flex-grow was applied to .rows , instead of .cells (individual cells) -->
<!-- so apply flex:1(i.e flex-grow 1) to all cells using .cells .. and when they are clicked, apply flex:3 to the clicked one using .active css-->
<!-- and why flex:3 and not any other number - because apne row me 3 cell hai, so were telling it to give the max size to the clicked one, and other two ko remaining size in equal proportions -->
<!-- flex-grow ke bina, cell only takes as much plac as the content needs ... so if one cell has more content, it would have occupied more space -->

<!-- image sizes are different, so they come on the web-page in different sizes !!!!solved (using px got consistency in all images)!!!!! -->
<!-- but doing px in images, after clicking a cell, they remain of the same size... i want them to increase ... i even tried putting % when they were clicked (using jquery .css) and when clicked back , make it 300px again ... but it wasnt working properly -->

<!-- images are not aligning in center of the cells  !!!!solved (using margin-auto ... but i wanted to do it using flex) !!!! -->

<!-- heading is not coming justified -->

<!-- unable to get login page on the button click ... the signup page i made ...  -->


<!-- new tag : 
date_time1
precedence (.active1.active1)
transtion

imp code : 
jquery
flex-grow -->
